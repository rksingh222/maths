        1. Percentage <br>
        formula
        if you have an area = length * breadth
        if you want to keep area constant
        length increases by 20% and we need to determine how much a breadth should reduce to get constant value
        the formula is if it is lenght increases by 1/x then the breadth decreases by 1/(x+1)
        
        however if it is mentioned that length decreases by 1/x then breadth should increase by 1/x-1
        
        2. some percentages to remember
        1/6 = 16.67
        1/7 = 14.28
        1/8 = 12.5
        1/9 = 11.1
    </div>
